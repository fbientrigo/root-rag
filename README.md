# root-rag
ROOT-RAG is a versioned retrieval system for the CERN ROOT codebase and documentation. It indexes C/C++ source, headers, and Doxygen comments and answers questions by returning **verbatim evidence with file paths and line ranges**. No hallucinated APIs, no inferred signatures, no silent version mixing.
